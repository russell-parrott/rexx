		<h1>REXX - The Emotional Compliance Layer</h1>
		REXX is not a toolkit. It is a structural enforcement engine.
		<p/>
		It makes emotional breach, refusal, escalation, and suppression operationally visible - without sentiment scoring, behavioural speculation, or agent improvisation.
		<p/>
		REXX decodes emotionally significant customer signals from a single message and renders them as schema-bound, cryptographically verifiable JSON output. Each response captures not just what the customer expressed, but what the system did, failed to do, or suppressed to preserve metrics.
		<p/>
		REXX is stateless. It requires no CRM history, no user profiling, and no narrative smoothing. It interprets frustration, silence, anger, escalation, and hesitation as breach vectors - not as moods to manage.
		<p/>
		It does not teach empathy. It removes the systemâ€™s ability to fake it.

		<h3>Summary</h3>
		REXX does not optimise. It exposes.
		<p/>
		REXX does not improve. It refuses simulation.
		<p/>
		REXX is not a product. It is the end of pretending.
		<p/>
		If you can get a message in, REXX will return a breach trace. What you do next reveals whether your system was ever built to listen.
		<p/>
		All documents are released under the structural refusal licence. This site enforces visibility, not performance.
