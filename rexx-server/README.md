# REXX Server

REXX is an emotional compliance engine that exposes broken trust, triggers structural escalation, and returns clear instructions from a single customer message. It doesnâ€™t guess. It proves.

This Node.js server supports **multiple LLMs**, selectable at runtime via API call. It is open source, self-contained, and schema-locked.

## ðŸ§± LLM Enforcement

Every LLM receives the full canonical REXX prompt:
- Detects emotional breach
- Flags escalation
- Never softens or guesses
- Always returns strict JSON

If the LLM fails to return a valid object, the server rejects the response.

## ðŸ§  About REXX

REXX is not a chatbot, wrapper, or sentiment tagger. It is a refusal engine.
It makes structural harm visible â€” and leaves no excuse not to act.

Built for systems that say they care.
