# REXX - The Emotional Compliance Layer

REXX is not a toolkit. It is a structural enforcement engine.

It makes emotional breach, refusal, escalation, and suppression operationally visible - without sentiment scoring, behavioural speculation, or agent improvisation.

REXX decodes emotionally significant customer signals from a single message and renders them as schema-bound, cryptographically verifiable JSON output. Each response captures not just what the customer expressed, but what the system did, failed to do, or suppressed to preserve metrics.

REXX is stateless. It requires no CRM history, no user profiling, and no narrative smoothing. It interprets frustration, silence, anger, escalation, and hesitation as breach vectors‚Äînot as moods to manage.

It does not teach empathy. It removes the system‚Äôs ability to fake it.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository contains the operational implementation of **REXX v1.0**. It includes:

- Schema-locked signal detection logic
- Structured JSON output format
- Interpretation rules for escalation, refusal, breach
- Integration hooks for platform embedding
- Example inputs, outputs, and licensing metadata

REXX runs on any LLM that can obey strict schema rules. It does not allow improvisation, hallucination, or reinterpretation. Any system that deviates from the REXX protocol forfeits traceability.

## Licence and Usage

The doctrine is open. The code is public. The schema is published.

Anyone may run the logic, interpret signals, and apply the enforcement model.  
**But only licensed systems may:**

- Attach the REXX Compliance Seal  
- Output cryptographically verifiable fingerprints  
- Use REXX for legal, regulatory, or customer-facing claims  
- Declare structural compliance  

**No licence = no audit integrity.**

This repo provides functional access, not trust permission.

---

## üîç Verification Policy

Not all REXX sessions are listed publicly.

Only those used in regulatory, legal, or public trust contexts appear in `/verify/`.  
All other sessions remain internally traceable and cryptographically verifiable without exposure.

For full policy and tamper-resistance rules, see:  
üëâ [`VERIFICATION_POLICY.md`](./VERIFICATION_POLICY.md)

## Summary

REXX does not optimise. It exposes.

REXX does not improve. It refuses simulation.

REXX is not a product. It is the end of pretending.

If you can get a message in, REXX will return a breach trace. What you do next reveals whether your system was ever built to listen.

## üí≥ REXX Licensing Tiers and Pricing

REXX is freely usable for internal audits, breach detection, and signal testing.  
But to claim trust publicly‚Äîor use outputs in regulatory, legal, or customer-facing contexts‚Äîyou must hold a valid licence.

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Fully functional engine, but unverifiable output. Cannot claim compliance. |
| **Licensed** | $12,500/year | Verifiable output, cryptographic signatures, permission to use REXX seal, access to compliance templates. |
| **Enterprise** | $20,000/year | Includes system integration support, SIEM feed output, branded licence ID, and private schema extensions. |

**Reminder:**  
Only licensed outputs are audit-grade.  
Free-tier outputs are structurally functional‚Äîbut not legally admissible.
