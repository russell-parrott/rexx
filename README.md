# REXX v1.0 ‚Äì The Emotional Compliance Layer

REXX detects emotional breach from a single customer message. It flags when trust is broken, when escalation is required, and what action must follow.

No CRM. No sentiment scoring. No performance theatre.
Just signal.

---

## üöÄ What REXX Does

REXX returns structured emotional breach data from one message:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "emotion": "anger",
    "intensity_of_emotion": 10,
    "severity": "high",
    "churn_risk_score": 10,
    "profanity_flag": false,
    "recommended_intervention": "Confirm cancellation immediately. Acknowledge delay and absence of response. Do not request additional effort from the customer.",
    "escalate": true,
    "escalation_reason": "Maximum emotional intensity with explicit withdrawal and unacknowledged repeat contact",
    "recommended_tone": "Direct, accountable, and non-defensive. Apologise without excuse. Confirm resolution without delay."
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Core Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `emotion` | Detected emotional signal |
| `intensity_of_emotion` | Scale 1‚Äì10 |
| `severity` | "low", "moderate", or "high" |
| `churn_risk_score` | Scale 0‚Äì10 |
| `profanity_flag` | Boolean: tone breach detected |
| `recommended_intervention` | Direct action instruction |
| `escalate` | Boolean: requires escalation |
| `escalation_reason` | Structural cause for escalation |
| `recommended_tone` | Blunt tone guidance ‚Äî no scripts |

## üîç What REXX Does NOT Do

- No mood tagging
- No CRM lookups
- No sentiment averages
- No empathy performance

REXX doesn‚Äôt guess. It proves.

---

## üîß How to Use REXX

- Input: One customer message (text or transcript)
- Output: JSON object with breach logic
- LLMs must strictly follow schema (see /prompt directory)
- Use output to drive escalation, refusal handling, or accountability

---

## üìå Requirements

- LLM-compatible environment (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude, Mistral)
- Prompt-lock enforcement if hosted
- JSON validator (optional)
- No customer history needed

---
REXX v1.0 ‚Äî Structural Fidelity Across LLMs

REXX is a prompt-based tool you can run it on any LLM that accepts text input and returns structured output but not all models behave the same ‚Äî yet.

To help individuals use REXX without needing technical fixes, we define two categories:

---

‚úÖ REXX-Compatible

These models can run the REXX prompt and return meaningful emotional breach data.  Some may omit fields, misformat JSON, or soften tone ‚Äî but the core logic still runs.

- Chat GPT (best match)
- Claude 3 (usable, sometimes verbose)
- Gemini 1.5 Pro (incomplete, often summarises)
- Cohere Command R+ (soft tone bias)
- Mistral (JSON issues, lower fidelity)

---

‚ùå REXX-Broken

Models in this category cannot currently return usable structured breach data from a single message without reformatting or intervention.
If you're using one of these, expect errors or empty fields.

(Currently none in this list ‚Äî but reserved for models that fail completely.)

---

‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Output Drift

Just because a model runs the prompt doesn't mean it returns all fields.
Some will miss recommended_tone, escalate, or escalation_reason.
Others may format answers in prose, not JSON.
That‚Äôs not your fault. That‚Äôs the model breaking the agreement.

We're tuning prompts per model to fix this. For now:

GPT-4o gives the best results

Others are usable, but may need inspection
---

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Reminder

If `escalate = true` and the system does nothing, that is not a miss. It‚Äôs a choice.

REXX doesn‚Äôt create accountability. It removes the excuse not to act.
